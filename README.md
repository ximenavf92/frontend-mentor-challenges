# frontend-mentor-challenges

I want to practice HTML, CSS & JS as I continue learning but I keep getting distracted with the design before I actually start coding anything. [FrontendMentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) has [challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) that provide the design & assets with a description of functionality, no need to waste time designing something just for practice or picking a [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) shot. I can start coding right away, we'll see how this goes.
